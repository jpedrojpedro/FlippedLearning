Study Platform to Aid Database Learning
-----
### AKA: DB Flipped Learning

**2013.2**

Elaboration of web platform which aids student learning of database dis- cipline. The topic came up from flipped classroom concept, whose model suggests online learning. The student attends, practice and discusses cer- tain subjects at home, bringing doubts to classroom. Thus, classes became more dynamic and less expository.

**Proposal:**

- Web platform with online exercises
- System focused in only one discipline (database)
- Web tool available only for students enrolled on Database I discipline
- Online feedback for the questions resolved
- Each student has his own instance (by exercises' list)
- Promote debate through web forum

**Project Details:**

- Question's correction and individual instances

- Only comparing query results can take into a false-positive on answers' correction
- Allow instance sharing between students (read-only mode)
- Allow student to rollback operation and recover state N-1
